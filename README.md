We rewrite [react-router](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router)'s [Address Book tutorial](https://reactrouter.com/tutorials/address-book) by [`solid-start`](https://start.solidjs.com);

## Developing

Once you've clone this project and installed dependencies with `pnpm install`, start a development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

## Building

Solid apps are built with _presets_, which optimise your project for deployment to different environments.

By default, `pnpm run build` will generate a Node app that you can run with `pnpm start`. To use a different preset, add it to the `devDependencies` in `package.json` and specify in your `app.config.js`.

## This project was created with the [Solid CLI](https://solid-cli.netlify.app)
